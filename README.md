A. Important considerations: ---------------------------------------------

    1. The current document gives a general overview of all work performed for the module **Programing and Scripting** along all individual weeks.

    2. The presented work started to be developed on 28Jan2023 to 1April2023 respectively correspondent week no1 and week no.8 of the module taughting period. 

    3. All the instructions and guidelines for each individual task can be found on Module material plataform "https://vlegalwaymayo.atu.ie/course/view.php?id=6208"

    4. Apart from week no.7 task all weeks have a dedicated python script which was developde/run  on "Visual Studio Code" program and posteriorly upload into the github 
    repository. Week no.7 has an extra text file important for the development of the specific task. 

    5. All details of each evaluated task are further described.
